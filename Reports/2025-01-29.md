# Team Report
## Goals from Last Week:
- Get project base set-up including the coding environment and API.
- Frontend: Simple account information will be displayed such as their username, profile picture, email etc
- Backend: The server should be able to communicate with the API! Set up communication so that we can pull the information needed for user information.

## Progress and Issues:
-We have an early functioning base webapp. Currently any spotify user can launch our app, be prompted to log-in to their spotify account and link to our Statify app, and sucessfully link. However, the ability to actually fetch user data is currently limited. The account who set up the API indeed have their data fetched upon logging in; currently they will see their account details, such as username and profile picture. We found out that since out app is in developer mode, only certain authorized users will be able to use our app. This should work fine for our development, we will just add the development team and any class staff to the list of authorized users. See this link for the info: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/quota-modes

## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Commence development of main theme for app. May use CSS or other tech such as react.
- Add all of the Statify team onto the authorized users list, so we can get to work in implementing the true functionality of our app.
- Commence work to fetch user listening data


# Contributions of Individual Team Members
## Goals From Last Week:
- Antonio, Aaron, and Ellie will set up the spotify API to get a working backend for the frontend to integrate.
- Elizabeth and Trinity will implement a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript program so that we have a working app to develop.
- Shraddha is our tester and debugger so she will make sure that our expectations are met.
- James will help out with backend and potentially some frontend work this week as a full stack developer.

## Progress and Issues:
- We have a project on the spotify API system online, which we can use to make calls. Currently it only works with the account that manages the API, but we will expand it to authorize the entire Statify staff.
- Very basic HTML has been made.

## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Trinity, Elizabeth, Aaron: Commence making API calls to fetch user data. First goal: get list of users top songs.
- Shraddha, Ellie, Antonio: Continue developing frontend UI look.
- James: Attempt to implement react.
