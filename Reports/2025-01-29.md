# Team Report
## Goals from Last Week:
- Get project base set-up including the coding environment and API.
- Frontend: Simple account information will be displayed such as their username, profile picture, email etc
- Backend: The server should be able to communicate with the API! Set up communication so that we can pull the information needed for user information.

## Progress and Issues:
-We have an early functioning base webapp. Currently any spotify user can launch our app, be prompted to log-in to their spotify account and link to our Statify app, and sucessfully link. However, the ability to actually fetch user data is currently limited. The account who set up the API indeed have their data fetched upon logging in; currently they will see their account details, such as username and profile picture. But any other users (ie. 99.9% of our target audience) won't be able to have their data fetched. This is not unexpected, we need to implement an authorization workflow in order to gain full authorization to user-data (other then that of the account that manages the API). Details for how we will go about this are here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-flow
-Potential Issue: How to ensure the 'Client Secret' can be securely stored.

## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Commence development of main theme for app. May use CSS or other tech such as react.
- Implement the authorization workflow, thus allowing us to have access to user data for any spotify user. This will likely be quite involved, but once finished, th rest of the project should be very doable.


# Contributions of Individual Team Members
## Goals From Last Week:
- Antonio, Aaron, and Ellie will set up the spotify API to get a working backend for the frontend to integrate.
- Elizabeth and Trinity will implement a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript program so that we have a working app to develop.
- Shraddha is our tester and debugger so she will make sure that our expectations are met.
- James will help out with backend and potentially some frontend work this week as a full stack developer.

## Progress and Issues:
- We have a project on the spotify API system online, which we can use to make calls. But we still need to make the authorization workflow to take full advantage
- Very basic HTML has been made 

## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Trinity, Elizabeth, Aaron + any other team member: Implement authorization workflow so we can actually use the web-app to fetch data from any spotify user.
- Shraddha, Ellie, Antonio: Continue developing frontend UI look
- James: Attempt to implement react
