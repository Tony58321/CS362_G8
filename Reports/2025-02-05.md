# Team Report
## Goals from Last Week:
- Starting development of the main theme of the app. We may use CSS or react for this purpose. 
- Adding our entire team to the authorized users list, so we are able to work on the implementation and the functionality of the app. 
- Starting work on fetching the user listening data. 

## Progress and Issues:
We have added all the members of our group as the authorized users and we are all able to access our application. All of us are able to login to the app and are able to link our Spotify account to our application. Currently, all the group members are added to the development team and we are able to see our username and profile picture once we log in. We have set up react and are using that for our front-end. Since a lot of us have not worked with this before, we were struggling to get this set up initially, but it has been working with no problems as yet. This week, we are planning to continue work on getting user listening data from the Spotify API and continue the backend development. 

## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Test and debug the login functionality if any problems arise. 
- Continue work on getting user listening statistics from the API.
- Checking the CSS styles for any accessibility usability issues. 
- Each group member starts work on their individual use case. 

# Contributions of Individual Team Members: 

# 1. Aaron Pina-Ramirez: 
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Commence making API calls to fetch user data. First goal: get list of users top songs. (as part of the backend team)

## Progress and Issues:
- Made a lot of progess on getTopTracks() function. Currently returns array of Track (aka Song) objects. Each object currently has each track title and the artists for that song.
- Worked on this with Antionio

## Current Plans and Goals:
- Work more on getTopTracks(), make it so it also returns the image url for the cover art for each track, link to the song. And consider what other things might be good to return for each track as well


# 2. Antonio Rodriguez :
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Develop a working backend to get user tracks.

## Progress and Issues:
- Aaron and I were able to use pair programming to print user tracks to the console, but it's not completely done yet.
- We moved to using React so we found out it was important to close any other ports so that there are no issues with fetching user data!

## Current Plans and Goals:
- Aaron and I plan to finish getting a user's track by getting a link to the song and image of the album.

# 3. Elizabeth Stahlke:
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Set up development environment.
- Work on front end of login page.
- Support login for multiple Spotify accounts.

## Progress and Issues:
I made progress with setting up the development environment using Vite. I also used the Spotify developer account that I created to whitelist the Spotify accounts of our groupmates. We are now all able to log into the application with our personalized data. I didn't make much progress with the front end, since we don't have much information to display to the user as of right now.

## Current Plans and Goals:
- Continue developing front end (JSX and CSS)
- Work on website design (potentially using prototypes) to get a good idea of what we want our application to look like.

# 4. Ellie Tanferani:
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Help with developing the front end.

## Progress and Issues:
- Am able to run the application on my computer.
- Learning how all of our tools and environment work together for this app, so I can contribute to development.

## Current Plans and Goals:
- Continue to work on the front end and develop the website design.
- Collaborate with teammates to design the UI.

# 5. James Grant:
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Investigate compatability of react with the spotify API.

## Progress and Issues:
- Created a template react app that connected to the spotify API.
- Aided other team members in understanding react.

## Current Plans and Goals:
- Help other team members understand react.
- Help design overarching UI.

# 6. Shraddha Hegde:
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Get access to the web application and get it set it up on my device on developer mode. 
- Test login functionality
- Manually test the UI and make sure it is accessible. 
- Help my teammates with initially getting the top tracks and artists for a user. 

## Progress and Issues:
The application is set up on my computer and front-end set up like react is also up and running. I will be testing the login functionality and make sure that the UI is looking good, and is functional and accessible. I had some issues with getting the application to run on my computer in development mode because I was working with software that I had not used before, but I asked my teammates for help and was able to fix this. I will be helping Ellie with getting the user’s top tracks and albums later this week

## Current Plans and Goals:
-Work with other members to get the user’s top tracks and artists and get it to display on our application. 
 
# 7. Trinity Paulson:
## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Set up login information
- Make a plan for front end

## Progress and Issues:
- I attempted setting up the login function, but the task ended up being better suited for a my team member.
- Began planning the front end

## Current Plans and Goals:
- Develope the front end for the backend functions that have been created. Specifically displaying of the top artist and top tracks.
