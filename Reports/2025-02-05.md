# Team Report
## Goals from Last Week:
- Starting development of the main theme of the app. We may use CSS or react for this purpose. 
- Adding our entire team to the authorized users list, so we are able to work on the implementation and the functionality of the app. 
- Starting work on fetching the user listening data. 

## Progress and Issues:
We have added all the members of our group as the authorized users and we are all able to access our application. All of us are able to login to the app and are able to link our Spotify account to our application. Currently, all the group members are added to the development team and we are able to see our username and profile picture once we log in. We have set up react and are using that for our front-end. Since a lot of us have not worked with this before, we were struggling to get this set up initially, but it has been working with no problems as yet. This week, we are planning to continue work on getting user listening data from the Spotify API and continue the backend development. 

## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Test and debug the login functionality if any problems arise. 
- Continue work on getting user listening statistics from the API.
- Checking the CSS styles for any accessibility usability issues. 
- Each group member starts work on their individual use case.
