# Team Report
## Goals from Last Week:
- Test and debug the login functionality, if any problems arise. 
- Continue work on getting user listening statistics from the API.
- Checking the CSS styles for any accessibility usability issues. 
- Each group member starts work on their individual use case.
## Progress and Issues:
Our team has made a lot of good progress this week including: fetching the top tracks for a specific user and presenting the results, debugging the login functionality, and beginning to style our webpage. An issue that came up is that the API wasn't working for some members in our group. We learned that some group members emails weren't connected to the API, so once we fixed this, it solved this issue. Now, all group members can view their top twenty tracks from the last 6 months of their connected Spotify account.
## Plans and Goals for Next Week:
- Continue to work on, and hopefully finish, the user interface and any styling of the webpage.
- Finish the functionality for fetching data on users top artists.
- Begin to add variations to the statistics that users can view: changing timeframe and number of tracks/artists.

## Previous Plans and Goals:
- Testing login functionality and making sure it is working for all team members.

## Progress and Issues:
- We were having issues with one of our team members login because we think their email was not verified with spotify which got fixed.
