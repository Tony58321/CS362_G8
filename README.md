# Statify Web Application
## Abstract:
Our project will be a statistics web application that connects with the popular music streaming platform Spotify . It will allow users to view key statistics related to their listening habits on Spotify. Users will log into the web-app interface with their Spotify account and then be able to view listening statistics, including their most listened to artists and songs. There will be various options for users to choose what data within what timeframe they want to view. The web-app will be implemented using the free API that Spotify provides (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). It will allow the application to authorize and fetch user data.

## Goals:
Our system will make statistics available to Spotify users, so that users can enjoy seeing information about their top music choices throughout a year. This is information that is not available with typical usage of the Spotify App, so it will give Spotify user’s a fun way to interact with their own statistics.
Our ultimate goal is to enrich users' music streaming experience by providing personalized statistics on:
- Top artists
- Top songs
- Top genres
- Correlations with national listening trends
